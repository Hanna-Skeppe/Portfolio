# Portfolio
Portfolio-project - My portfolio!
This project is a part of Technigo Bootcamp, and the portfolio will be updated as I finish more projects throughout the course.

# About the project
The site is tested on mobile and desktop, and on the following browsers: Chrome, Edge and Firefox. It has been tested with screenreader in Chrome and with WAVE accessibility evaluation tool. Tested also with Lighthouse.

It was really fun making the portfolio. My main struggle this week was to find time to finish the project. At first I didn't think it would be so very time-demanding, but it turned out to be quite a time consuming project. What took a lot of time was the CSS foremost. When adding media-queries for bigger screens it turned out I had to re-think my code structure a bit. And all in all I think that the strucure of my CSS and naming of classes could probably be improved a bit. I might have used uneccesary classes for the differnt sections since they are styled in a similar way. But I think this is a learning path for me to be better at this with more experience.
Reading up on, and implementing the testing and accessibility features was really fun as well. This is also a thing I learned from this project that these important aspects also needs to be taken into account when planning how much time a project will take. It was really interesting to think about how make a site accessible for people with different abilities to use a computer. One example was that I had to change my colors quite a bit, and to add overlays on pictures with text on, as to not get contrast-errors.
I will come back to this project from time to time to add more projects as they are finished.
