# Portfolio
Portfolio-project - Technigo Bootcamp week 8

# About the project
I have tested the site on mobile and desktop, and on the following browsers: Chrome, Edge and Firefox.
I have tested the site with screenreader in Chrome, which seemed to work fine when tabbing through the page. I used tabindex and/or aria-label to get the screenreader to read the content that wasn't read at first try.
I also tested the site with WAVE accessibility evaluation tool and made changes so that I had no errors or contrast errors left.
Tested also with Lighthouse and made adjustments mainly regarding sizes of pictures to gain a higher score. All scores are a 100% or close to it, except for the performance score on mobile which still is a bit low (between 62-75%, it varies and I don't really know why). One thing that Lighthouse gave feedback on was that I could improve performance by using other optimized image formats. I tried to converte JPEG-images to JPEG 2000 but I didn't get that to work. The images didn't show. I didn't have time to try to convert images to the other suggested formats.
I added og-tags for red level also.

It was really fun making the portfolio. My main struggle this week was to find time to finish the project. At first I didn't think it would be so very time-demanding, but it turned out to be quite a time consuming project. What took a lot of time was the CSS foremost. When adding media-queries for bigger screens it turned out I had to re-think my code structure a bit. And all in all I think that the strucure of my CSS and naming of classes could probably be improved a bit. I might have used uneccesary classes for the differnt sections since they are styled in a similar way. But I think this is a learning path for me to be better at this with more experience.
Reading up on, and implementing the testing and accessibility features also proved quite time-consuming. This is also a thing I learned from this project that these important aspects also needs to be taken into account when planning how much time a project will take. It was really interesting to think about how make a site accessible for people with different abilities to use a computer. One example was that I had to change my colors quite a bit, and to add overlays on pictures with text on, as to not get contrast-errors.
